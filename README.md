A Python-based file encryption and decryption application using **AES-256** with a **user-friendly GUI**, developed as part of **CODTECH Internship – Task 4**.

---

## 📌 Features
- AES-256 file encryption
- Secure password-based key derivation (PBKDF2)
- Random salt and IV for enhanced security
- Supports encryption of any file type
- Easy-to-use graphical interface (Tkinter)
- Safe and lossless decryption

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Cryptography library
- Tkinter (GUI)
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function)

---

# Architecture Overview

## Workflow

User Input → Password → PBKDF2 → AES Key  
File → Padding → AES Encryption → Output File

## Decryption Flow

Encrypted File → Extract Salt + IV → AES Decryption → Original File

🎯 Project Use Cases

  -Secure file storage

  -Confidential data sharing

  -Educational cybersecurity demo

  -Internship project submission
